                    I’m a <span class="color-text">Business and Information Systems</span> Major from a little town in Central New Jersey, but these days I’m located up north in the <span class="color-text">New York Metropolitan Area</span>.

                    I’ve been tinkering with computers since as far back as I can remember, and what was originally an interest has turned into a passion.
                    
                    I want to leverage my knowledge of computing and design into a full-fledged career, armed with some <span class="color-text">accounting</span> and <span class="color-text">web-design experience</span>.
